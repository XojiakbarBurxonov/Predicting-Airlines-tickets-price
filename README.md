This study evaluates the performance of various machine learning models for predicting airline ticket prices, focusing on Random Forest, XGBoost, Bagging Regressor, and deep learning models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The models were assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R², with Random Forest emerging as the top performer, achieving the lowest MAE and RMSE, and the highest R² score (97.923%).

Key findings:

Top Performers: Random Forest and XGBoost excelled in capturing complex, non-linear relationships in pricing data, outperforming traditional pricing methods like Yield Management and Expected Marginal Seat Revenue (EMSR).
Key Predictors: Variables like "days left to departure," "class," and "duration" were identified as key drivers in determining ticket prices.
Dynamic Pricing: The machine learning models provided a more dynamic and accurate pricing approach, offering real-time adaptability and improving revenue management strategies.
Challenges:

Data constraints and issues with handling outliers, particularly in edge cases like last-minute bookings, impacted model performance.
Future Recommendations:

Advanced Techniques: Further research could explore reinforcement learning to improve model adaptability and accuracy.
Cross-Industry Applications: The model could be applied to other industries, such as hotel and ride-sharing services, to assess its versatility and impact on dynamic pricing.
Impact:
This project provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in dynamic pricing, offering actionable recommendations for the airline industry to optimize revenue and improve pricing accuracy. The findings contribute to both the theoretical and practical advancement of machine learning applications in revenue management strategies.
